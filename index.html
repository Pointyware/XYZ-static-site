      <h1>XYZ - Get your X from Y to Z</h1>
      <p>XYZ is attempting to cut out the middleman, Uber, to provide more compensation to drivers and lower prices for riders. We want to allow drivers to legitimately be their own boss, instead of being a cog in the Uber machine &ndash; and "legit" means "legal" &ndash; so we're also helping drivers navigate the complexity of starting and running their own business, including managing assets, revenue, taxes, employees, and on. We are not a rideshare company, we are a rideshare platform.</p>
      <p>Our mission is ultimately to operate our service for drivers and riders at-cost, and to be a community-driven project.</p>
